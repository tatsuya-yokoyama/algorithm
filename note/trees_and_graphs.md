# Trees and Graphs
Tree and graph problem is more complicated than linreary organized data structure such as an array or linked list.

## Types of Trees
### Definition
We can define trees by a recursive explanation.
- Each tree has a root node
- The root node has zero or more child nodes
- Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on

### Binary Trees
A binary tree has a tree in which each node has up to 2 child nodes
If a node has no child nodes, this node is called a leaf

## Question
### 4.1 Route Between Nodes
Use either depth-first search(DFS) or breadth-first search(BFS).
Consider tradeoffs between them

#### DFS
- simply implement with recursion

#### BFS
- find the shortest path
  - consider all the friendships in the world
